# Machine Learning Projects: Regression Analyses

## Overview
This repository hosts two regression analysis projects using Python: a multivariate linear regression to predict concrete strength and logistic regression models for students' admissions predictions.

## Projects

### Linear Regression on Concrete Strength
- **Datasets**: concrete_strength_train.csv, concrete_strength_test.csv, y_concrete_strength_test.csv
- **Description**: Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict concrete strength.

### Logistic Regression on Graduate Admissions
- **Part 1: Admit Prediction**
  - **Objective**: Predict the probability of admission (binary outcome) using logistic regression.
  - **Dataset**:Data: gradadmission.csv
Part 1: Binary logistic regression to predict admission status.
Part 2: Multi-class logistic regression to predict undergraduate school rank.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Python library for implementing regression models.
- **Pandas** and **Numpy**: Data handling and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization libraries.

## Usage
Navigate to the specific project directory and run the python scripts.
